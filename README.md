# Competitive Heatmap Visualizer

Transform text-heavy competitive analysis from any LLM into an interactive, color-coded heatmap to instantly spot market gaps and opportunities.

Try it here: https://teamonics.github.io/competitive-heatmap/

## What It Does

This tool takes JSON-formatted competitive analysis data (generated by ChatGPT, Claude, or any LLM) and visualizes it as an interactive heatmap grid where:

- **Cells are color-coded** from red (score 1) to green (score 5)
- **Clicking any cell** reveals detailed analysis comments
- **Rows represent competitors**, columns represent features
- **Market gaps become immediately visible** through color patterns

## Quick Start

1. Open `competitive-heatmap.html` in any modern browser
1. Click **“Copy Prompt to Clipboard”**
1. Paste the prompt into your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
1. Customize the `[Company A, Company B, Company C]` and `[Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3]` placeholders
1. Copy the JSON response from the LLM
1. Paste it into the tool and click **“Generate Heatmap”**

## Prompt Template

The tool includes a ready-to-use prompt that instructs LLMs to output properly formatted JSON:

```
Compare [Company A, Company B, Company C] on these features: [Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3].

Return ONLY a JSON code block with no other text. Use this exact format:

{
  "competitors": {
    "Company A": {
      "Feature 1": {"score": 4, "comment": "Brief analysis"},
      "Feature 2": {"score": 3, "comment": "Brief analysis"}
    },
    "Company B": {
      "Feature 1": {"score": 2, "comment": "Brief analysis"},
      "Feature 2": {"score": 5, "comment": "Brief analysis"}
    }
  }
}

Rules:
- Scores must be integers from 1 (worst) to 5 (best)
- Include a brief comment explaining each score
- Output ONLY the JSON code block, nothing else
```

## Expected JSON Format

```json
{
  "competitors": {
    "Slack": {
      "Pricing": {"score": 3, "comment": "Mid-range pricing with limited free tier"},
      "Integrations": {"score": 5, "comment": "2,400+ apps, best-in-class ecosystem"}
    },
    "Microsoft Teams": {
      "Pricing": {"score": 4, "comment": "Bundled with M365, great value"},
      "Integrations": {"score": 4, "comment": "Strong Microsoft ecosystem"}
